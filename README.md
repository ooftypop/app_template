# Name
  [Ooftypop](https://ooftypop.com/)'s Rails Application Template


# Description
  This is the template Ooftypop uses as the foundation for most Rails applications. The template simply speeds up the process of launching an MVP, because gems and scripts integral to Ooftypop's Rails development team are included in this template. Not every feature included in this template will necessarily be used.


# Installation

  1. bundle install
  2. Create and seed DB
  3. Create .env file, and add API keys
  4. Add .env file to .gitignore

  <br />


  *This app uses Ruby v. 2.3.0 and Rails v. 5.2.2*

  <!-- This application connects to multiple APIs and outside services. Doing so requires access keys for each connected service. The keys are stored as ENV Variables in the .env file.
  There is an example .env file which is included in the application repository. Use this as a framework for creating your own .env file locally. Be sure to .gitignore your.env file
  prior to pushing to origin or making a PR. -->
